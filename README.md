# Timer-Clock
The timer takes users time and starts a countdown after the countdown is over it plays a sound effect of the users choice

For the timers sound effect to work you'll need to change the path in the code to where your sound effect is.

This is my personal apllication that I use because I find it to be more reliable then random timers from the internet. 

:D
